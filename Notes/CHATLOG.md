**Done:**
- Evaluated the codebase — first a single-pass review, then an exhaustive multi-agent workflow
  (172 agents across map / review / verify / completeness / synthesize). The verify phase was hit
  by transient rate-limiting, so critical findings were re-verified by hand against source.
- Landed repo hygiene + the first test suite (DECISIONS D1) and five BMS*/BI* correctness fixes with
  regression tests (D2); 33 tests pass. Opened PR #1.
- Deep-dived the Laplace model-prior definition: established that `laplace_evidence.py` computes a
  mislabeled likelihood-weighted joint, not the data-free `Z_Mx` the paper defines. Wrote
  `docs/plan-zmx-laplace.md` and logged D3.
- Adopted the `antagonistic_collab` `Notes/` decision-log workflow (this file, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `SCRATCHPAD.md`) and documented the convention in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Committed:** 5d15853 (hygiene + tests), 569ee39 / f218dea / 84568fc (correctness fixes),
c5562a3 (Z_Mx plan). PR #1: https://github.com/suyoghc/bistar_gp_c/pull/1

**Key discussion — Construction I vs II for the GP-informed model posterior:**
Starting from a single GP-induced joint prior over (M, φ) shows the model-prior integral `Z_M` and
the parameter-prior normalizer `Z_prior` are the same integral, so they cancel and the consistent
posterior is `∝ N(M)` (Construction II). This corrected an earlier off-hand framing of II as
"double counting" — it is not. Recommended II as canonical, with a no-GP baseline and Construction I
(GP as a separate model-prior factor) as an ablation ladder.

**Open:** confirm Construction II canonical + Occam default; implement the plan on `fix/laplace-zmx`
after PR #1 merges. See `Notes/SCRATCHPAD.md`.
