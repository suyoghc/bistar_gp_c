## D1: Repo hygiene + first test suite (commit 5d15853, PR #1) — 2026-07-01

**Problem:** 740 tracked files / 72 MB. 254 PNGs, 8 `.npz` HMC caches, 6 slurm logs, and `.DS_Store`
were committed before `.gitignore` existed, so the ignore rules never took effect. Four
byte-identical duplicate scripts. No test suite for numerically delicate GP code.
**Decision:** `git rm --cached` the already-ignored artifacts (files kept on disk); commit
`.gitignore` so it sticks; delete the 4 duplicates (canonical copies kept in `bistar_viz/scripts/`
per README); add `tests/` + a root `conftest.py`. Tracked files 740 → 458, repo 72 MB → 11 MB.
**Alternatives considered:** Leave artifacts tracked (rejected: bloat, and ignore rules silently
ineffective). `metrics_v2.py` / `aggregation_v3.py` were left untouched — verified they are the
live modules, not superseded versions.

## D2: BMS*/BI* correctness fixes (commits 569ee39, f218dea, 84568fc; PR #1) — 2026-07-01

**Problem:** A multi-agent evaluation plus direct verification found five result-invalidating bugs
in the default pipelines.
**Decision (each fix has a regression test):**
- `soft_transfer` (bms_star.py:435): per-row (per-draw) max shift reweighted GP draws; replaced
  with a single global scalar (posterior-preserving).
- `compute_G_matrix` (bms_star.py:390): `10*max_finite` sentinel is the *best* score for
  negative-valued metrics (pw_nll); replaced with a strictly-worse penalty.
- `AdditiveGPModel` (model.py:25): kernels double-registered via a ModuleList **and** covar_module,
  so HMC saw duplicate latent sites (7 vs 4 for the toy model); hold components in a plain list so
  covar_module is the sole registration path.
- `fit_mcmc_simple` (fit.py:89): used gpytorch's per-datum-averaged MLL, tempering the MH target to
  posterior^(1/n); multiply by n to recover the summed log joint.
- `decompose_model` (debias.py:68): `full_std` summed component covariances, dropping cross terms;
  compute the true sum-kernel posterior covariance instead.
Also added a defensive `period_length` branch in `aggregation_v3.py:330` (not result-invalidating:
`period_length` has no prior, so it is never sampled).
**Result:** 33 tests pass. Verified live: HMC latents 7 → 4; the soft_transfer distortion was
demonstrated numerically ([0.501, 0.289, 0.210] correct vs [0.476, 0.302, 0.222] as-implemented).

## D3: Z_Mx / Laplace model-prior definition and posterior assembly (OPEN — plan committed c5562a3) — 2026-07-01

**Problem:** `laplace_evidence.py::compute_laplace_evidence` computes a Laplace approximation to
`∫ p(y|φ)·exp(−Ḡ/τ) dφ` — a likelihood-weighted joint mislabeled as "model evidence." The paper
defines `Z_Mx` as a **data-free** model prior (README:90; `kb/Wiki/GP-Induced Model Priors.md`:25),
matching the viz reference `model_priors_laplace.py:251`. Verified analytically and numerically:
code output = (proper within-model evidence) + log Z_noOccam. It also feeds
`bistar_sample_size_sweep.py:234` and `bistar_induced_prior_v2.py:208`, producing figures
inconsistent with the viz path.
**Decision (proposed; full spec in `docs/plan-zmx-laplace.md`):** Make the package compute the
data-free `Z_Mx` (expand at argmin Ḡ, Hessian of Ḡ, optional `−log V_ref` Occam term); add the
within-model evidence and an ordinary-evidence primitive; expose model selection as an **ablation
ladder** — baseline (no GP) / Construction I (GP as model prior × ordinary evidence) / Construction
II (GP-induced joint prior, posterior ∝ N(M)) — with **Construction II as canonical**. Unify the
package and viz implementations; migrate the two callers above.
**Alternatives considered:**
- Construction I as canonical: kept only as an ablation. The joint-prior derivation (§2.1–2.2 of the
  plan) shows II is Bayes-consistent and not double counting, which is why II is canonical.
- Leave-as-is / relabel only: rejected — disagrees with the viz `Z_Mx` figures and mislabels the object.
- Occam default: no-Occam (faithful original BI*, README default); with-Occam (`−log V_ref`) shown as
  a sensitivity analysis. The `V_ref` (parameter-box) dependence is a real modeling knob to defend.
**Status (updated 2026-07-01):** Construction II **confirmed canonical** (user). PR #1 merged
(`origin/main` 76df156). **Core implemented + tested** on `fix/laplace-zmx`:
`laplace_log_Z_Mx` (data-free prior, Occam toggle), `laplace_log_evidence_ordinary`,
`laplace_log_evidence_induced` (N/Z_prior), `model_posterior(construction=baseline|I|II)`, and a
robust `_laplace_logdet` (clips eigenvalues to fix the boundary curvature-fabrication issue).
`compute_laplace_evidence` / `compute_all_laplace_evidences` / `LaplaceResult` **removed**; callers
`bistar_sample_size_sweep.py` and `bistar_induced_prior_v2.py` migrated to
`model_posterior(construction="II")` with redesigned decomposition/ablation figures; `laplace_evidence`
now self-registers its default metric (imports `metrics_v2`). Parked eval follow-ups also done:
`pyproject.toml`, dedup `build_toy_kernels`, `InducedPriorResult` collision renamed
(`mechanism.py` → `CandidateInducedSamples`), optional RNG `seed=` on `fit_mcmc_simple`/`fit_hmc`.
`tests/test_laplace_zmx.py` **42 tests pass** (adds default-metric-registration and
II-decomposition-identity). README Occam section updated to the canonical API + ablation ladder.
**Still OPEN (held deliberately — needs a decision or compute):** (1) unify the two self-contained viz
Laplace scripts (`model_priors_laplace.py`, `model_prior_trajectory_laplace.py`) onto
`laplace_log_Z_Mx` — blocked on the single-`G` choice (they use a variance-weighted MSE, not a package
METRIC; this is the paper's metric-choice decision); (2) regenerate all figures + old-vs-new impact
assessment (needs a torch runtime); (3) update `kb/Wiki/GP-Induced Model Priors.md` (gitignored).

## D4: HMC sample-site naming fallout + MH target fixes (fix/laplace-zmx) — 2026-07-01

**Problem:** The D2 single-registration fix renamed every kernel latent from
`kernel_components.{i}.*_prior` to `covar_module.kernels.{i}.*_prior`, but three consumers still
parsed the old names: `extract_gp_predictives` (bms_star.py:269), `decompose_model_hmc`
(debias.py:175), and the seven `hp_pattern` strings in mechanism.py. On any fresh HMC run, every
kernel hyperparameter draw was silently dropped, so GP predictives were built at default-initialized
kernel hyperparameters (only noise varied), invalidating BMS* scoring, decompositions, and mechanism
figures with no error raised. Two related fit.py bugs: (1) `fit_hmc`'s pyro target called both
`model.pyro_sample_from_prior()` and `likelihood.pyro_sample_from_prior()`; the likelihood is an
ExactGP submodule, so the noise prior registered twice (5 latents for 4 toy hyperparameters) and the
phantom `likelihood.noise_covar.noise_prior` column held pure prior draws. (2) `fit_mcmc_simple`
evaluated its MH target in eval mode, scoring `train_y` against the posterior predictive conditioned
on `train_y` itself (data used twice; the D2 `*n` factor amplified the bias); its proposal also
double-counted the noise parameter (same tensor reached via both model and likelihood
`named_parameters()`).

**Decision:** One naming authority in model.py, next to `AdditiveGPModel`: `select_hmc_sites()`
picks the connected latents across archive eras (current runs; legacy duplicate-site archives in
`bistar_gp/cache/*.npz` and `runs/*/samples/`, where `covar_module.kernels.*` and the bare
`noise_covar.noise_prior` were the wired sites; post-fix noise naming
`likelihood.noise_covar.noise_prior`), and `apply_hp_value()` parses and sets one hyperparameter,
accepting current and legacy names. All three consumers migrated onto the helpers; mechanism.py
patterns updated to `covar_module.kernels.*` with `find_hp_key` canonicalizing legacy keys before
matching. fit.py: module-level `_hmc_pyro_model` samples priors exactly once; `_mh_log_joint`
forces train mode on every call; MH parameter list deduped by object identity.

**Alternatives considered:** Patching the three string filters in place (rejected: leaves the naming
logic in three copies, the exact drift that caused this bug). Keeping the separate likelihood
sampling call and filtering the phantom site downstream (rejected: NUTS still wastes work on a
disconnected latent and the samples dict still carries a prior-only column).

**Result:** 56 tests pass (14 new: era selection, value application, a trace of the actual fit_hmc
target, train-mode MH target, `extract_gp_predictives` kernel-draw propagation). End-to-end NUTS
smoke run: 4 sample sites, one noise latent, varying lengthscale draws in the predictives.
**CORRECTION (see D6):** this entry's implication that the HMC path was fully correct was WRONG.
D4 fixed the duplicate noise latent but not the deeper disconnection (`_hmc_pyro_model` scored the
un-sampled model, so NUTS still targeted the prior); the "varying lengthscale draws" smoke did not
distinguish prior from posterior since prior draws also vary. Fixed in D6.
**Consequence:** every committed HMC archive (`bistar_gp/cache/*.npz`,
`runs/mauna_loa_sub150_hmc_*`) predates the D2 fix (biased target, duplicate sites) — regenerate
before quoting paper numbers; the Della impact assessment must rerun on the fixed code.

## D5: Reference-volume consistency, τ-invariant Z_Mx clipping, weighted-transfer max shift — 2026-07-02

**Problem:** Three review findings. (1) `laplace_log_evidence_ordinary` always subtracted
`log V_ref` while `Z_Mx` and `N(M)` only did so with `occam=True`, so with `occam=False` (the
default) cross-construction gaps in the ablation ladder absorbed per-model volume differences
(log V_ref: 3.57 Linear vs 7.46 Sin+Linear — a ~49x odds artifact inside what the figure labels
"the GP contribution"). (2) `laplace_log_Z_Mx` minimized f = Ḡ/τ, so the absolute eigenvalue floor
in `_laplace_logdet` fired τ-dependently (τ-sweeps bent for numerical, not statistical, reasons),
and `_laplace_log_integral` discarded `n_clipped` — a floored flat direction silently adds
−½·log(1e-8) ≈ +9.2 nats of evidence. (3) `aggregation_v3.soft_transfer_weighted:402` kept the
per-candidate (axis=0) max shift that D2 removed from `bms_star.soft_transfer`; two candidates with
equal weighted Boltzmann mass got 0.434/0.566 instead of 0.50/0.50 (pre-existing on `main`, reached
via `run_weighted_bms_star` from `experiments/bms_star_v3_comparison.py`).

**Decision:** (1) `laplace_log_evidence_ordinary` gains `occam=True` (standalone default keeps the
proper marginal-likelihood semantics); `model_posterior` threads its `occam` flag into every
construction. The flag now has one module-wide meaning: include the −log V_ref term of the
normalized uniform reference prior; `occam=False` integrates against the raw Lebesgue measure
everywhere (faithful no-Occam BI*). (2) `Z_Mx` optimizes and differentiates Ḡ itself and applies τ
analytically — log Z = −Ḡ*/τ + (d/2)log(2πτ) − ½log|H_Ḡ|, the identity the module header already
documented — so clipping decisions are τ-invariant by construction; `n_clipped` now propagates into
`ZMxResult`/`EvidenceResult`/the Construction-II components with a logger warning. Floor/cap values
unchanged (pinned by tests; intentional mitigation per D3). (3) Global scalar max shift in
`soft_transfer_weighted`, mirroring the D2 fix and comment.

**Alternatives considered:** A floor relative to the largest eigenvalue (τ-invariant and
scale-aware) was rejected: with the 1e12 cap in place a fabricated cliff eigenvalue would drag the
floor up to ~1e3 and corrupt genuine O(1) curvature. Making `numerical_hessian` bounds-aware was
deferred — the review's verifier showed the sentinel-cliff path is unreachable with the shipped
parameter spaces, so surfacing the diagnostic is the honest fix.

**Result:** 63 tests pass (7 new: volume-free construction gaps under a constant metric, occam
toggle on the ordinary evidence, exact analytic τ-scaling checked at τ=1e12, flat-direction
`n_clipped` flag, weighted-transfer direct formula / equal-mass 0.5-0.5 / global-offset invariance).
Live demo on the toy spaces: II−baseline gaps no longer track log V, and the new warning immediately
surfaced a real flat direction at Sin+Linear's joint MAP (1 of 6 eigenvalues floored) that was
previously invisible.

## D6: fit_hmc sampled the prior, not the posterior (multi-model review catch) — 2026-07-02

**Problem:** Before the Della re-validation, a 5-model review panel (Gemini 3.1 Pro, Kimi K2-thinking,
GLM-5.2 via OpenRouter; codex/gpt-5.5 on the real repo; Fable adjudicating) reviewed the D3–D5 diff.
codex — alone among the panel — caught that `_hmc_pyro_model` discarded the return value of
`model.pyro_sample_from_prior()`. In gpytorch 1.15.1 that method deep-copies the model, applies the
sampled hyperparameters to the COPY, and returns it; the original `model`/`likelihood` are unchanged.
The target scored `likelihood(model(x))` on the ORIGINAL module, so the obs likelihood was independent
of the sampled latents and NUTS targeted the **prior**: every `fit_hmc` "posterior" draw was a prior
draw. **Pre-existing** — main's inline `pyro_model` had the same discard pattern (plus the duplicate
noise latent D4 removed); the D4 change fixed the duplicate latent but not the disconnection, and the
D4 regression test passed because it checked latent-site COUNT, not whether obs depends on the latents.

**Decision:** `_hmc_pyro_model(model, x, y)` now scores through the returned module:
`sampled = model.pyro_sample_from_prior(); pyro.sample("obs", sampled.likelihood(sampled(x)), obs=y)`.
Dropped the now-unused `likelihood` parameter (caller `partial(_hmc_pyro_model, model)`). Added
`test_hmc_target_connects_latents_to_likelihood`: conditions the latents at two values and asserts the
obs log-prob MOVES (the check a site-count test cannot do). Site names are unchanged, so
`select_hmc_sites`/`apply_hp_value` and archive compatibility are unaffected.

**Verification:** Direct experiment (orchestrator + Fable, independently): conditioning obs on
latents 0.5 vs 2.5 gave an identical obs log-prob under the old target (disconnected) and a moving
one under the fix (connected). gpytorch source confirms the copy semantics; the original
`likelihood.noise` is unmutated after the call. **66 tests pass** (1 new connection test; D4 trace
test updated to the new signature).

**Panel notes (recorded, not fixes):**
- Kimi's sole CRITICAL — "MLL is summed, so ×n over-inflates by n" — is a FALSE POSITIVE for
  gpytorch 1.15.1: `ExactMarginalLogLikelihood.forward` ends `res.div_(num_data)`, so it is per-datum;
  measured `mll=−1.61686`, `mll×n=−48.50574=` the independently summed log joint. The D5 (D2) `×n` fix
  is correct. Gemini and GLM agreed.
- `fit_mcmc_simple` proposes in raw unconstrained space while scoring constrained-space priors without
  the constraint Jacobian (codex MEDIUM, GLM): **pre-existing**, and `fit_mcmc_simple` is documented as
  a non-production starting point (fit_hmc/NUTS is production). Non-blocking follow-up.

**Consequence:** independently reconfirms that **all committed HMC archives** (`bistar_gp/cache/*.npz`,
`runs/mauna_loa_sub150_hmc_*`) are prior-only and MUST be regenerated on the fixed code before any
paper number is quoted. Panel verdict was NO-GO on the pre-fix branch; GO after this fix.

## D7: prior/posterior predictive sampling (one pipeline, two checks) — 2026-07-02

**Problem:** The core package could only sample the posterior (`fit_hmc`); prior sampling existed
only as scattered numpy reimplementations in `bistar_viz/scripts/`. A prior predictive check (are the
GP's prior beliefs — the ones BI* transfers into `Z_Mx` — reasonable before seeing data?) and a
posterior predictive check (does the fitted GP reproduce the data?) had no shared, first-class path.
Motivated by the D6 finding: the bug was accidentally producing prior draws via NUTS, i.e. prior
sampling done the expensive/wrong way.

**Decision:** Two minimal additions that share the existing predictive pipeline and the `fit_hmc`
dict schema.
- `fit.py::sample_prior(model, n_samples, seed)` — i.i.d. draws from the registered priors by
  tracing `model.pyro_sample_from_prior()`; **no NUTS** (the priors are known distributions, so draws
  are exact and ~instant), values in the same constrained space `fit_hmc`/`apply_hp_value` use.
- `bms_star.py::extract_gp_predictives(..., condition_on_data=True)` — `True` (default) keeps the
  posterior predictive p(y*|X,y,θ); `False` gives the prior predictive p(y*|θ) = GP prior at x_eval
  (ZeroMean → mean 0, cov K_θθ(x_eval)+σ²I), no conditioning on data.
So: prior predictive check = `sample_prior` → `extract_gp_predictives(condition_on_data=False)`;
posterior predictive check = `fit_hmc` → `extract_gp_predictives(...)`.

**Alternatives considered:** Sampling the prior via NUTS (rejected — wasteful and can mix poorly;
i.i.d. is exact). Unifying the scattered `bistar_viz/scripts/` prior-predictive reimplementations
into this path (deferred — tangled with the still-open single-`G` metric decision that blocks the
other viz-unification work). A `.rsample()`-style helper drawing actual y* realizations (deferred —
callers can draw from the returned Gaussians; keep the addition minimal).

**Result:** 72 tests pass (6 new: prior-sample schema/i.i.d./data-freeness, prior-predictive exact
analytic covariance + zero mean + data-independence, posterior-predictive data-dependence,
posterior≤prior variance invariant). Adversarially reviewed (independent agent, ran its own checks:
constrained-space match vs a real HMC run, NaN-train leakage test, exact-covariance sensitivity) —
verdict SHIP, no defects.

## D8: taming the Mauna Loa NUTS funnel (init_to_map + max_tree_depth) — 2026-07-03

**Problem:** Post-D6, fit_hmc targets the real posterior, and the Mauna Loa run became
intractable: Della job 10584302 timed out at 14/400 warmup iterations, step size collapsing
7.2e-01 → 3.3e-07 with tree depth saturating (~72 min/iteration). Diagnosis: the noise
posterior genuinely concentrates near zero (monthly-averaged CO2 is nearly noiseless;
posterior noise ≈ 7e-4 ± 1e-4 normalized), so the stiff region IS the typical set — the
sampler cannot avoid it, and uncapped depth-10 NUTS trees (up to 1023 leapfrog steps, each a
Cholesky + backward) explode per-iteration cost. Head-to-head at SUB=30 (28 iterations):
tree-cap=7 + MAP-init 29.2s (1.04 s/it) vs MAP-init alone 230.7s vs old behavior 138.2s —
the CAP is the operative fix (MAP-init alone starts in the stiff region and is slower);
all three configs agree on the posterior (noise 0.0006–0.0007 ± 0.0001), consistent with
max_tree_depth being bias-free (it shortens trajectories, not the stationary distribution).

**Decision:** `fit_hmc` gains `init_to_map=True` (init each latent at the model's current
constrained value via pyro `init_to_value`; named_priors name == sample-site name, proven by
a transforms round-trip test) and `max_tree_depth=10` (pyro default, now exposed).
`impact_assessment.mauna()` passes `max_tree_depth=7` via `inspect.signature` dispatch (NOT
try/except TypeError, which would swallow an internal TypeError and silently rerun uncapped);
the old worktree arm keeps its signature — and is fast anyway since pre-D6 it samples the
prior. `experiments/bms_star_mauna_loa.py` and `experiments/mauna_loa.py` now MAP-fit the
model actually passed to fit_hmc (they used to fit one model and pass a fresh default one)
and set `max_tree_depth=7`.

**codex review (FIX-FIRST → fixed):** (1) CONFIRMED: a constrained value that underflows to
exactly 0 sits INSIDE the closed support GreaterThanEq(0) yet maps to -inf under
biject_to(support).inv, so pyro retries the same fixed init until "cannot find valid initial
params" — reproduced, then fixed by checking finiteness of the unconstrained image (support
membership is the WRONG predicate), clamping into the interior, and falling back to
init_to_sample with a warning if still invalid. (2) The two stale experiment call sites above.

**Result:** 75 tests pass (3 new: kwargs smoke, init_to_value transforms round-trip,
boundary-underflow survival). Projection for Della: ~0.1 s/leapfrog at SUB=150 × ≤127 steps
≈ ≤13 s/it → 400 iterations ≈ 90 min (was: >8 h timeout). Note for the paper: any change to
the NOISE PRIOR itself (e.g. bounding it away from zero) is a modeling decision, deliberately
not taken here — these are pure sampler-efficiency knobs.

**Status (updated 2026-07-03, mixing validation — IMPORTANT QUALIFIER):** Two independent
2-chain validations (sub=60; capped depth-6, warmup 100; and capped depth-8 + DENSE adapted
mass, warmup 200) show the capped sampler is fast and divergence-free but does NOT mix within
hundreds of iterations: ESS ≈ 1 and split-R̂ 4–81 on every kernel hyperparameter (chains rest
at trend lengthscale 8 vs 32 with a 418-nat log-joint gap between their mean points — a stuck
chain, not a benign flat ridge or genuine multimodality). The one healthy direction is the
NOISE (R̂ 1.06, ESS 12), which is what this entry's "configs agree" check measured — so the
depth cap is bias-free in principle but the practical chains are far from stationarity in the
lengthscale/outputscale directions. Dense mass adaptation does not rescue it (5× cost, same
ESS=1): the curvature is position-dependent, so no constant mass matrix conditions it.
**Implication:** a capped Della `--mauna` run is valid for the D6 old-vs-new IMPACT story
(old arm = prior draws, new arm = data-informed draws near the MAP — a large, honest,
qualitative shift) but its kernel-hyperparameter "posteriors" must carry a non-convergence
caveat and are not paper-grade. Paper-grade full-Bayes on Mauna Loa needs one of: (a)
Laplace-preconditioned NUTS (FIXED inverse mass from the MAP Hessian, adaptation off — the
one cheap sampler idea not yet tried; adapted-mass failure does not rule it out), (b)
reparameterization (significant work), or (c) rescoping full-Bayes mauna out of the paper's
figures (MAP + Laplace machinery, the paper's primary path, is unaffected). (OPEN — fork
belongs to the user.) Diagnostics: scratchpad nuts_diag_out/{validate,round2_dense}.json.

## D9: GP inference as selectable options, thesis-anchored default (fit_gp) — 2026-07-04

**Problem:** The user wants every methodological choice explicit and selectable, with defaults
matching the thesis chapter (Chandramouli 2020 Ch. 5). For GP hyperparameter inference the chapter
prescribes full-Bayes sampling of the joint posterior (p. 172–173) — Appendix II (p. 221): VI
(gpflow) was the PRIMARY implementation, HMC (GPy) the cross-check, "similar" results, 10k samples /
1k burn-in — with MAP/MMLE as the explicitly-contrasted simpler alternative (Fig. 6 vs 7a). The repo
only exposed fit_hmc (+ fit_map separately, different output shape).

**Decision:** `fit.py::fit_gp(model, lik, x, y, method=...)` — every method returns the SAME dict
schema as fit_hmc (site name → (n,) constrained array), so options flow through
extract_gp_predictives/BMS*/decompose unchanged and are directly comparable:
- `"hmc"` (DEFAULT): existing NUTS path with D8 knobs. Thesis-equivalent (validated cross-check);
  chosen over literal-primary VI because it is the path this codebase has verified end-to-end
  (D6 connection test, D8).
- `"vi"` (fit_vi): ADVI-style pyro SVI, AutoMultivariateNormal guide in unconstrained space,
  MAP-initialized via the shared init_to_value machinery. The thesis's literal primary method;
  funnel-immune (pragmatic recommendation for Mauna until the D8 mixing fork closes).
- `"map"` (fit_map_samples): MAP/MMLE as length-1 arrays — the thesis's contrast case, now
  pipeline-compatible (degenerate posterior).
- `"hmc_laplace"` (fit_hmc_laplace): NUTS on the Laplace-whitened posterior z = A⁻¹(u−u_MAP),
  A = chol(H⁻¹), H = MAP Hessian of the potential in unconstrained space via initialize_model +
  autograd; eigenvalue floor 1e-6; falls back to identity whitening with a warning. NOTE: a linear
  reparameterization ≡ mass-matrix preconditioning, so this single option delivers both the
  "Laplace-preconditioned NUTS" and "reparameterized HMC" items; a NONLINEAR reparameterization
  (e.g. signal-to-noise) remains the open D8 fork.

**Result:** 84 tests pass (9 new: per-method schema/finite/positive, MAP point-estimate equality,
VI concentrates vs prior (noise sd ≪ prior sd), pipeline flow-through for map/vi, unknown-method
error, plus the D10 identity below). Justification writeup for the paper:
`docs/inference-and-metric-options.md`.
**codex review (FIX-FIRST → fixed, same day):** (1) the D8 boundary guard existed only in fit_hmc's
inline init loop, so an underflowed-to-zero hyperparameter crashed the NEW vi/hmc_laplace init paths
— `_map_init_values` is now the single guarded authority (biject_to-finiteness clamp, ValueError if
irreparable; fit_hmc falls back to init_to_sample), with boundary regression tests for both paths.
(2) fit_hmc's `.squeeze()` returned 0-d arrays at n_samples=1, breaking the (n,) schema promise and
crashing extract_gp_predictives — now `.reshape(-1)`, pinned by a test. (3) the VI concentration test
could pass with n_steps=0 (MAP init alone) — replaced with a fresh-model learn-vs-no-learn contrast
(n_steps=0 stays at init 0.69; 400 steps drops below 0.2), so a future detached-gradient regression
fails the test. codex independently verified the ELBO gradient path through gpytorch's
setting_closure is alive, and hmc_laplace's flatten/whiten/transform round-trip is correct.
88 tests pass.

## D10: the "single-G decision" dissolved — viz metric ≡ pw_kl_vcal — 2026-07-04

**Problem:** The viz-script unification (D3 open item) was blocked on choosing a single canonical G:
the viz scripts use a "pointwise variance-weighted MSE" while the package default METRIC is
pw_kl_vcal — believed to be different quantities requiring a paper-level decision.

**Decision/Finding:** They are the SAME function. viz `compute_G` = mean((μ_GP−μ_θ)²/(2σ²_GP));
`pw_kl_vcal` = mean(0.5(μ_θ−μ_ψ)²/σ²_ψ) = KL(N(μ_ψ,σ²_ψ)‖N(μ_θ,σ²_ψ)) — identical formulas
(viz adds only a 1e-6 variance floor). Verified numerically to 1e-12
(tests/test_fit_gp_options.py::test_viz_variance_weighted_mse_is_pw_kl_vcal). Consequences:
(1) the package default is simultaneously a KL variant — the thesis's named family (Ch.5 p.174–175:
metric "chosen by the investigator… one or another variant of KL divergence") — AND numerically
identical to what the viz-reference figures used; the default needs NO change and satisfies both
anchors at once. (2) The metric option family already exists (METRICS + metrics_v2 with
justification-grade docstrings: variance-calibrated / mean-only / GP-anchored); documented per-option
in docs/inference-and-metric-options.md. (3) The residual viz/package difference is upstream and
estimator-level only: viz importance-weights PRIOR hyperparameter draws by marginal likelihood, the
package uses genuine posterior draws with uniform weights — same mixture-of-Gaussians target, same
mixture-moment formulas (compute_averaged_gp vs aggregation_v3.average_gp_posterior), better
estimator in the package. Viz unification is therefore UNBLOCKED: port the scripts onto
laplace_log_Z_Mx with metric_name="pw_kl_vcal" and posterior draws.
**Thesis nuance recorded for the paper:** the chapter's aggregation is hard best-match assignment
(p. 174); the package's soft-τ Boltzmann transfer is the practical relaxation (τ→0 recovers it).
**Scope qualifier (codex review):** the identity holds for GP pointwise variance ≥ 1e-6; below that
the implementations' variance FLOORS differ (viz clips at 1e-6, package `_extract_marginals` at
1e-10) and they diverge by the floor ratio — pinned in
`test_viz_and_package_floors_diverge_below_1e6_variance` and qualified in the docs. For the viz
unification, adopt the package floor (closer to the un-floored mathematics).
